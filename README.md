# Genetic risk score analysis

This repository has several files for generating Genetic risk Scores using Type 1 Diabetes SNPs as an example and should be used in the following order:

1. Extract_SNPs_for_GRS.sh (extract SNP to be used in GRS from genotyped data)
2. Scores_for_DR3-DR4_haplotype.R (assigns scores for DR3/DR4 SNPs)
3.
