# Genetic risk score analysis (GRS1) for Type 1 Diabetes 

This repository has several files for generating Genetic risk Scores using Type 1 Diabetes SNPs as an example and should be used in the following order:

1. Extract_SNPs_for_GRS.sh (extract SNPs to be used for generating GRS from genotyped data)
2. T1D_GRS1.R (assigns scores for DR3/DR4 haplotype SNPs and constructs T1D GRS1)
3. Plot_GRS1.R (plots GRS1 scores for cases and controls)
